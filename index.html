        <h2>Student, Bob Jones University</h2>
        
         <p>I am a Christian, a Marine veteran, and a senior undergraduate student at Bob Jones University. I will graduate in May with a B.S. in Business administration with a minor in Communications.</p>
         <p>
            I spend most of my free time with my wife, and we both like having friends over for meals, games and general "hanging out" (often involving homework). The only hobby I have is strength training with a natural bodybuilding focus, though I am somewhat casual about it. 
         </p> 
         <p>
            I also believe that both using and not using the oxford coma are acceptable decisions, some situations fitting one better, others the other.
